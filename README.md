# SimpleRecommendationEngine

This project demonstrates a movie recommendation system using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity. It utilizes a dataset of movies and their descriptions to recommend movies similar to a user's query.

Introduction
Recommendation systems are widely used to provide personalized suggestions to users. In this project, we have implemented a movie recommendation system using natural language processing techniques. We use the TF-IDF vectorization method to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors and then calculate cosine similarity between movies to provide recommendations.

Key features of this project:

TF-IDF vectorization to represent movie descriptions.
Cosine similarity to find similar movies.
Interactive querying for movie recommendations.
